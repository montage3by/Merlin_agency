description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "create a plot arc", "story structure", "add a plot point", "story timeline", "track foreshadowing", "pacing", "sagging middle", "act structure", "story arc", "plot outline", "snowflake method", or wants to plan and manage the narrative structure of a story. It owns book-level pacing; NOT for scene outcomes or writing a chapter hook (use scene-craft), or a pacing check as a revision pass (use revision-continuity).

# Plot Structure

## Overview

Plan and manage story arcs, plot points, setups and payoffs, and the narrative timeline. Each arc is a markdown file in `plot/arcs/`, and `plot/timeline.md` holds the planned events and backstory in story order. The plot index lists all arcs, their status, and theme coverage.

## Prerequisites

A story project must already exist (created via the story-init skill). Verify by checking for `story.md` in the project root.

## Choosing a Story Structure

1. Read `story.md` for genre, themes, and `form` (`novel`, `novella`, `novelette`, `short-story`, `flash`, `serial`, `picture-book`, `chapter-book`). For `short-story` and `flash`, use `references/short-story-form.md` instead of a multi-act beat sheet
2. Consult `references/structure-models.md` for available structures
3. Recommend a structure based on genre (default to three-act if unclear). If the user wants to design the whole book top-down before drafting, or asks for the Snowflake Method, follow `references/snowflake.md` on top of the chosen structure
4. Update `plot/_index.md` frontmatter `structure` field
5. Populate the story structure section with the beat sheet
6. When the outline settles which chapter carries a beat, record it as that chapter's `beat` (see Recording Beats on Chapters)
7. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story wordcount . --write`, and `story check .`

## Recording Beats on Chapters

A chapter's optional `beat` frontmatter field names the beat-sheet beat it delivers, so `story grid`, `story context`, and the codex can show the structure chapter by chapter.

1. Use the beat names of the model in `plot/_index.md`, as `references/structure-models.md` spells them (`Inciting Incident`, `Midpoint`, `All Is Lost`, `Ten (Twist)`), or the writer's own label when they adapt the model. The field is free text, and the CLI checks only that it is text, not that it names a known beat
2. Write it with the chapter: `story add chapter '{Title}' --number {N} --beat '{Beat}'`, or add `beat: {Beat}` to an existing chapter's frontmatter. Quote a value that looks like a number or contains `: ` or `#` (`beat: "Try/Fail #2"`), since an unquoted `#` starts a comment
3. Keep it a short label: `story validate` warns `beat-too-long` above 60 characters. What happens in the beat goes in the chapter's `## Outline`
4. Leave `beat` off the chapters between beats. A beat that runs over several chapters, such as Fun and Games, goes on the chapter where it starts
5. Run `story reindex .`, `story wordcount . --write`, and `story check .`, then `story grid .`. Once any chapter has a beat, the grid shows a `(beat)` row above its hook and outcome rows. Check each beat against its position in the model (a Midpoint near the middle chapter, All Is Lost near three quarters of the way through): beats that bunch up, or a long run of chapters with none, are where a middle sags

## Creating an Arc

1. Read `story.md` for themes
2. Read `plot/_index.md` for existing arcs
3. Read `characters/_index.md` to understand available characters
4. Ask for:
   - Arc name
   - Type (main, subplot, character, thematic)
   - Which characters are involved
   - Which themes it serves
   - Which MICE threads the arc carries (optional `mice-threads:` frontmatter, written as a block list with one `- event` or `- character` item per line, or as a `[event, character]` flow list; see `references/mice-quotient.md`)
5. Build the arc through conversation: setup, escalations, climax, resolution
6. Scaffold the file with `story add arc '{Name}' --type main --character {id} --theme '{theme}'`, which writes `plot/arcs/{arc-name-kebab}.md` with the sections of `references/arc-template.md` and lists the arc in `plot/_index.md`, then fill in the sections. Without the CLI, write the file from `references/arc-template.md` to `plot/arcs/{arc-name-kebab}.md`
7. Leave the arcs table in `plot/_index.md` to `story reindex .`, which rebuilds it from the arc files; never add a row by hand
8. Update the hand-written `## Theme Tracking` section in `plot/_index.md`
9. If characters are referenced, verify they exist in `characters/`
10. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story wordcount . --write`, and `story check .`

## Managing Plot Points

Plot points live within arc files in the "Plot Points" table. When adding a plot point:

1. Read the relevant arc file
2. Add the plot point to the table with chapter reference (if known)
3. Add the event to `plot/timeline.md` in chronological order
4. If the plot point sets up a later payoff or raises a question, record it in the one place Setup and Payoff Records below gives it
5. When CLI access is available, run `story reindex .`, `story wordcount . --write`, and `story check .`

## Timeline Management

`plot/timeline.md` is the hand-kept plan: a chronological list of the story's events across all arcs, including backstory and events not drafted yet. It does not own when a drafted scene happens: the scene's `date` and `time` do, and `story timeline .` orders the drafted scenes from them. Do not add a plan row for each drafted scene.

When adding events:
- Insert in chronological order
- Keep entries concise (one line per event)
- Use the `| When | Event | Arc | Chapter |` table with these cell formats:
  - **When:** story-relative time for story events (e.g. `Day 1, morning`), or how long ago for backstory (e.g. `12 years ago`, `~300 years ago`)
  - **Event:** one concise line describing what happened
  - **Arc:** the arc's display name as written in its file (e.g. `The Drowned Witness`), or `-` when the event belongs to no arc. `story rename arc` rewrites ids but not display names, and nothing checks this cell, so after renaming an arc search for the old name (`grep -rn "Old Name" .`) and update each hit by hand, including the timeline rows
  - **Chapter:** `Ch {N}` once the event is written (e.g. `Ch 1`), or `-` for backstory and unwritten events. Once a row has a chapter, its scenes' `date` and `time` say when it happens: if the row's **When** disagrees, the scene is right, so correct the row

When reviewing the timeline:
- Run `story timeline .` to see written scenes in story-time order from their `date`/`time` fields, with scenes told out of order marked, and compare it with `plot/timeline.md`
- Run `story diagram timeline` for a Mermaid timeline of dated scenes and chapters, and `story diagram arcs` for which chapters advance each arc (add `--out dist/<name>.mmd` to save either; keep generated diagrams out of entity folders)
- Run `story grid .` for the plot grid: arcs as rows, chapters as columns, an `x` where a chapter or its scenes list the arc in `arcs-advanced`, plus each chapter's `beat` (once any chapter has one), hook, and scene outcomes. Use `--format csv` for a spreadsheet and `--from`/`--to` for a range of chapters. An empty row is an arc no chapter advances, a long gap is an arc the reader may forget, and an `(unknown)` row is an `arcs-advanced` id with no arc file
- Check for chronological consistency
- Identify pacing issues (too many events clustered, long gaps)
- Flag arcs that haven't progressed

## Pacing, Outcomes, and Hooks

Two optional fields make pacing checkable:

- Scene `outcome`: `yes`, `no`, `yes-but`, or `no-and` — whether the POV character got what they wanted in the scene. `yes-but` and `no-and` are the complicating outcomes that drive a plot forward (see the `scene-craft` skill).
- Chapter `hook`: how the chapter ends — `cliffhanger`, `question`, `revelation`, `reversal`, `decision`, `emotional`, or `resolution`.

Plan both in the outline, then run `story pacing .` for a per-chapter dashboard of words, scene and sequel counts, scene outcomes, and hooks. It warns about three or more consecutive `yes` outcomes (no pressure), four or more scene units with no sequel (no breath), chapter length outliers (over twice or under half the median once three chapters have prose), three or more consecutive chapters ending on `resolution`, and drafted chapters with no `hook`. Treat the warnings as prompts to reread, not rules: a quiet `resolution` chapter after the climax is right.

## Setup and Payoff Records

Each setup has exactly one record. Pick it by use, update only that record, and never copy a setup into a second place:

| Use | Record | Create with | Checked by |
|-----|--------|-------------|------------|
| A mystery clue or red herring | `continuity/clues/{id}.md` | `story add clue '{Title}' --planted chapter-{NN} --payoff chapter-{NN}` | `story clues`, `story continuity` |
| Any other setup the reader is owed a payoff on: a Chekhov's gun, a vow, a prophecy, a deadline | `continuity/promises/{id}.md` (`references/promise-template.md`) | `story add promise '{Title}' --arc {arc-id} --planted chapter-{NN}` | `story continuity` |
| A question the reader is left asking | `continuity/questions/{id}.md` (`references/question-template.md`) | `story add question '{Title}' --introduced chapter-{NN}` | `story continuity` |
| A hint inside one arc that needs no checked payoff: an image, a motif, an echo | a row of the arc's `## Foreshadowing` table | by hand | only its `chapter-NN` ids, by `story check`; not its status or payoff |

A promise or clue record is `planned` until the setup is on the page, then `planted` with `planted: chapter-{NN}`, then `paid-off` with `payoff: chapter-{NN}`. `--payoff` may name a chapter with no file yet, and so may `--planted`, which then records the setup as `planned`. When `--planted` names a chapter that has a file, `story add` records `planted` even if that chapter is still an outline, so pass `--status planned` until the setup is drafted. A question is `open` with `introduced: chapter-{NN}` until it is `answered` with `resolved: chapter-{NN}`. The records give a promise, clue, or question its `arcs` and `characters`, so the arc's `## Foreshadowing` table holds only the arc's small hints, each with **Planted**, **Payoff**, **Chapter Planted**, **Chapter Payoff**, and a **Status** of `planned`, `planted`, or `paid-off`.

`story context` packs the open promises, clues, and questions into each chapter's drafting context, chapter-writing's outline step reads the arc Foreshadowing rows planned for that chapter, and `story next .` counts the open questions and the promises and clues still `planned` or `planted`. For mystery clues, `story clues .` prints a clue-by-chapter fair-play matrix and `story diagram clues` the plant-to-reveal flow (see the `genre-craft` skill).

Scaffold chapters and scenes with `story add chapter '{Title}' --number {N} --pov {id} --arc {arc-id}` and `story add scene '{Title}' --chapter chapter-{NN} --scene {M} --pov {id} --location {id}`, then write the prose and outline content into the created files. Set `outcome` on scene records and `hook` and `beat` on chapters as the outline settles them, then run `story reindex .`, `story wordcount . --write`, and `story check .`, then `story pacing .`.

When pacing or the outline calls for reordering, move the files with the CLI rather than renaming them, because chapter and scene ids encode their numbers and clues, promises, questions, and the timeline point at them:

- Move a scene to another chapter with `story move scene chapter-{NN}-scene-{MM} --chapter chapter-{NN} --path .` (next free number; add `--scene {M}` to place it), or reorder within its chapter with `--scene {M}` alone
- Renumber a chapter with `story move chapter chapter-{NN} --number {N} --path .`. A taken number is refused, so to open a gap move the later chapters up one, highest first, then `story add chapter '{Title}' --number {N}`
- `move` rewrites ids, links, and bare ids in `plot/timeline.md`, arc files, and the `plot/_index.md` Theme Tracking table, but not `Ch {N}` cells, prose, or outline beats: update those by hand, then run `story reindex .`, `story wordcount . --write`, and `story check .`, then `story pacing .`

For splits, merges, and the full checklist, follow the `revision-continuity` skill's Structural Edits section.

## Cross-Referencing

- Arcs reference characters via frontmatter `characters` field
- Arcs reference themes via frontmatter `themes` field
- Plot points reference chapters
- Timeline entries link arcs and chapters
- Theme tracking in `plot/_index.md` maps themes to arcs and chapters
- Promises and questions reference chapters, arcs, and characters where relevant

## CLI Maintenance

Use the Story CLI when it is available. If `story` is not installed, use the bundled fallback `node ../story-maintenance/scripts/story.js` with the same arguments. Use `node <checkout>/bin/story.js` instead only when the user names a Story Skills repository checkout or you are working in one. Write the script as an absolute path (resolve the fallback relative to this skill folder) and run it from the folder you would run `story` from, so `.` and other relative paths keep their meaning. Use Node, not Bun or a package script: Bun would load that folder's `bunfig.toml` (which can run code) and `.env`, and a package script runs from the checkout's root. If no CLI is available, perform the registry, backlink, and word-count checks manually.

## Reference Files

- **`references/arc-template.md`** - Template for arc files with frontmatter and sections
- **`references/question-template.md`** - Template for continuity questions and mysteries
- **`references/promise-template.md`** - Template for setup/payoff tracking
- **`references/structure-models.md`** - Story structure models (three-act, hero's journey, save the cat, kishotenketsu, five-act, Fichtean curve, Harmon's story circle) with beat sheets
- **`references/mice-quotient.md`** - MICE threading: milieu/inquiry/character/event threads, start/end rules, and the optional `mice-threads:` arc frontmatter
- **`references/short-story-form.md`** - Short fiction form: one dominant change, single effect, narrow scope, and the `form` field (`story init --form short-story` or `flash`)
- **`references/outlining-ladder.md`** - Premise → beat sheet → step outline → full outline, with exit criteria per rung (cross-links discovery-drafting)
- **`references/snowflake.md`** - Snowflake Method: ten top-down design steps from one-sentence summary to first draft, each mapped to `story.md`, character, arc, and scene files and the CLI commands that scaffold them

## Shared Conventions

Every story skill follows the shared conventions in [`../story-maintenance/references/conventions.md`](../story-maintenance/references/conventions.md), resolved relative to this skill folder. Read it before creating, renaming, or linking story files. If that file is missing because this skill was installed without `story-maintenance`, the essentials are: kebab-case ids and filenames, YAML frontmatter on every story-project file, `_index.md` registry tables that `story reindex` rebuilds (never edit them by hand), bidirectional links between entities, `characters` for who is on the page and `mentions` for who is only referred to, `status: deceased` plus `died-in: chapter-{NN}` for deaths, and no project-local generator or build scripts (run only the installed or bundled Story CLI).
